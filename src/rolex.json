        "description": "Rolex was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London and later moved to Geneva. It gained fame for innovations like the first waterproof watch, the Oyster, in 1926, and the self-winding Perpetual rotor in 1931. Known for iconic models like the Submariner and Daytona, Rolex has become a symbol of luxury and precision in watchmaking."
